Project 5 for Google Developers Scholarship Nanodegree (ABND track)

This Android application was created as part of my Google Developers Scholarship Nanodegree - Android Basics.
The purpose of the app is to fetch JSON data from The Guardian using a http request and parse the JSON response to display data
about News articles including the Web Title, Date and Section (e.g. Film, Music) of the articles.
The data is loaded using a Loader with an AsyncTask to fetch the News.
