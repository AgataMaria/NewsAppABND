Project 6 & 7 for Google Developers Scholarship Nanodegree (ABND track)

This Android application was created as part of my Google Developers Scholarship Nanodegree - Android Basics. 
The purpose of the app is to fetch JSON data from The Guardian using a http request and parse the JSON response 
to display data about News articles including the Web Title, Date and Section (e.g. Film, Music) of the articles. 
The data is loaded using a Loader with an AsyncTask to fetch the News.

The app also has a settings menu, that allows the user to change the news displayed by user's chosen search query or sort them by order of: newest, oldest, relevance (if there is also a search query value present). The app amends the query url in the background to return different results.
